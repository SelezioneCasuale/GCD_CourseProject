* The run_analysis.R script  automatically download required data, unzip      them, navigate through folders, upload and analyze data as required, create a tidy data set in .xlsx format and save it in your working directory. 
If you already downloaded and unzipped the data, simply comment or skip the first seven lines of code (i.e, start from line 8/9).
The original dataset for the analysis can be accessed here:

(see the R script)


* The CodeBook.md file provides a more detailed explanation of what the R script does, step by step

* The dataSet.xlsx file contains the required new tidy dataset. On the Coursera site it's been uploaded as a .pdf file (.xlsx cannot be used), but the data are exactly the same.
